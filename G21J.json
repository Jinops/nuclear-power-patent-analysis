These systems include a micro-fusion propulsion system providing thrust for redirecting a small asteroid, as well as providing a particle cushion at a landing site for a soft-landing. The systems deploy deuterium-containing fuel material as a localized cloud interacting with incoming ambient cosmic rays to generate energetic fusion products. Dust or other particulate matter in the fuel material converts some cosmic rays into muons that also catalyze fusion. The fusion products provide thrusting upon the asteroid. The fusion products also aid deceleration of incoming asteroids to be mined for a soft landing upon a lunar or planetary surface.","patent_date":"2020-10-27","inventors":[{"inventor_country":"US","inventor_key_id":"12303"}],"assignees":[{"assignee_country":null,"assignee_key_id":null}],"applications":[{"app_number":"15832480","app_date":"2017-12-05","app_id":"15\/832480"}],"cited_patents":[{"cited_patent_number":"4036012"}],"citedby_patents":[{"citedby_patent_number":null}],"cpcs":[{"cpc_section_id":"B","cpc_group_id":"B64G","cpc_subgroup_id":"B64G1\/40","cpc_subsection_title":"Aircraft;

Imminent prediction of the earthquake with occurrence time, location and magnitude may give people time to prepare for it and minimize the loss. Unfortunately, imminent prediction of the earthquakes, especially those without foreshocks, is very difficult if not impossible. This invention discloses a method and system that work around the difficulty of the imminent prediction of the earthquake. Instead of trying to predict the occurrence, it triggers the earthquake artificially at a known time so that evacuation and other preparations can be accomplished prior to the triggering time of the earthquake to reduce the loss caused by the earthquake. The artificial triggering of the earthquakes may be implemented by at least one underground nuclear explosion.","patent_date":"2016-05-10","inventors":[{"inventor_country":"CA","inventor_key_id":"52670"}],"assignees":[{"assignee_country":null,"assignee_key_id":null}],"applications":[{"app_number":"12138388","app_date":"2008-06-12","app_id":"12\/138388"}],"cited_patents":[{"cited_patent_number":"RE36282"},{"cited_patent_number":"6308135"},{"cited_patent_number":"6462549"},{"cited_patent_number":"6728640"},{"cited_patent_number":"7234897"},{"cited_patent_number":"7280920"},{"cited_patent_number":"7598884"}],"citedby_patents":[{"citedby_patent_number":null}],"cpcs":[{"cpc_section_id":"G","cpc_group_id":"G01V","cpc_subgroup_id":"G01V1\/008","cpc_subsection_title":"Measuring; testing","cpc_group_title":"Geophysics; gravitational measurements; detecting masses or objects; tags"},{"cpc_section_id":"G","cpc_group_id":"G01V","cpc_subgroup_id":"G01V1\/06","cpc_subsection_title":"Measuring; testing","cpc_group_title":"Geophysics; gravitational measurements; detecting masses or objects; tags"},{"cpc_section_id":"G","cpc_group_id":"G21J","cpc_subgroup_id":"G21J3\/00","cpc_subsection_title":"Nuclear physics; nuclear engineering","cpc_group_title":"Nuclear explosives; applications thereof"}]},{"patent_number":"9562938","patent_title":"Method and system to detect and characterize electromagnetic pulses for the protection of critical infrastructure components","patent_abstract":"A system and method are proposed to protect critical infrastructure assets from an electromagnetic pulse event.

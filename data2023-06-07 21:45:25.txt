The fusion reactor includes two internal magnetic coils suspended within the enclosure and positioned on opposite sides of the midpoint of the enclosure, one or more encapsulating magnetic coils positioned on each side of the midpoint of the enclosure, two mirror magnetic coils positioned on opposite sides of the midpoint of the enclosure, and one or more cooling lines within each of the internal magnetic coils. The cooling lines carry a coolant and are operable to remove heat from the internal magnetic coils. The one or more encapsulating magnetic coils and the two mirror magnetic coils are coaxial with the internal magnetic coils. The magnetic coils are operable, when supplied with electric currents, to form magnetic fields for confining plasma within the enclosure.

The reactor operates on the ability to change at least four separate variables in each of a plurality of lenses that are independent of the other lenses. This allows for the generation of Alfvén waves and modulation of the internal plasma dynamics, actively leading to higher states of efficiency. By combining modulation of a plasma in the form of an ion beam with a solid state metal target, an efficient fast neutron source can be produced. This can lead to industrial applications such as energy generation, nuclear clean-up, the production of rare earth metals out of semi-rare ones, and helium production.

The apparatus of the embodiments include interior, electron-extraction electrodes to remove cold, trapped electrons and replace them with hot electrons. Hot electrons efficiently confine a dense, hot plasma fuel. The method of the embodiments discloses a procedure for controlling the reactor during its start-up phase of operation. During start-up the reactor is changed from being in a cold, empty state to being in a stable steady-state of energy production. Reliable computer simulation predicts that in steady-state the disclosed apparatus and method will produce usable net-power continuously and for an indefinite period of operation. The full-scale reactor design is suitable for replacing most of the world's existing coal-fired power production with a clean, safe energy production alternative.

The system comprises a vessel into which a fluid is injected through one or more inlet ports and a fluid circulating system configured to circulate the fluid through the vessel such that the fluid is removed from the vessel through an outlet port and is returned back into the vessel through the one and more inlet ports. A first spinner is mounted at one wall of the vessel while a second spinner is mounted at the opposite wall of the vessel such that the second spinner is at some distance away from the first spinner and it faces the first spinner. When the fluid circulating system starts circulating the fluid within the vessel a vortex cavity is formed that extends between the first and the second spinners so that one end of the vortex cavity sits on the first spinner while the opposite end of the vortex cavity sits on the second spinner.

The device includes a plasma accelerator with a high compression funnel section extending from an inlet of the accelerator and an elongated section connected to the high compression funnel section that can extend from the end of the funnel section to an accelerator's outlet. The funnel section can be a cone with a steep tapering while the elongated section can have a mild, gentle, tapering along its length toward the outlet. The device further includes a power source for providing a current pulse to the accelerator to generate a pushing flux to accelerate and compress a plasma torus throughout the accelerator. The current pulse can be so shaped so that the current pulse behind the plasma torus at the outlet of the elongated section is significantly smaller than the current pulse at the first end of the elongated section while the pressure of the plasma torus at the outlet of the elongated section is greater than the pressure of the plasma torus at the beginning of the elongated section.

Such magnetic fields can: (a) permit the recovery of ignition, or at least significant alpha particle heating, in submarginal NIF targets that would otherwise fail because of adverse hydrodynamic instability growth, (b) permit the attainment of ignition in conventional cryogenic layered solid-DT targets redesigned to operate under reduced drive conditions, (c) permit the attainment of volumetric ignition in simpler, room-temperature single-shell DT gas capsules, and (d) ameliorate adverse hohlraum plasma conditions during laser drive and capsule compression. In general, an applied magnetic field should always improve the ignition condition for any NIF ignition target design.

The elements are rectangular shaped concave small expansion lenses matched to rectangular convex collimating lenses. Absorbing sheets divide an overall large volume up into smaller volumes to minimize losses due to amplified spontaneous emission. This arrangement has various applications, particularly in inertial confinement technology, where it may be used to extract energy from KrF laser media energized by electron beams. For certain applications, this regime of the gain medium may have zones at the absorbing sheets where this is no gain.

Dust or other particulate matter in the fuel material converts some cosmic rays into muons that also catalyze fusion. The fusion products provide thrusting upon the asteroid. The fusion products also aid deceleration of incoming asteroids to be mined for a soft landing upon a lunar or planetary surface.

The foam skeleton is then melt-infiltrated with a tritium breeder material, for example, lithium zirconate or lithium titanate. The foam skeleton is then removed to define a cellular breeder component having a network of interconnected tritium purge channels. In an embodiment the ligaments of the foam skeleton are enlarged by adding carbon using chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) prior to melt-infiltration. In an embodiment the foam skeleton is coated with a refractory material, for example, tungsten, prior to melt infiltration.

The HTS assembly comprises a plurality of parallel arrays of HTS tapes arranged to pass through the central column, each array comprising a plurality of HTS tapes arranged such that c-axes of all tapes in an array are parallel to each other, and such that planes of the HTS layers of the HTS tapes are perpendicular to a first radius of the central column. Each HTS tape has a c-angle which is an angle between a perpendicular to a plane of an HTS layer of the HTS tape and the c-axis of the tape. The plurality of arrays comprises first and second sets of arrays. Each array within the first set of arrays comprises HTS tapes of a first type having a first c-angle, and each array within the second set of arrays comprises HTS tapes of a second type having a second c-angle which is greater than the first c-angle. The first set of arrays are arranged closer to the first radius than the second set of arrays.

The gas flows collide and form a gas channel from the neutral gas, the gas channel having a gas density depression at the center of the intersecting gas flow, where the gas density depression is surrounded by a higher density gaseous wall along the central axis.

Forming the Halbach transformers of heating to the primary magnetic field coils of confinement in a typical ring cusp confinement device configuration may reduce high-voltage breakdown along coil supports. By heating the plasma transverse to the confinement field a greater number of particle species may be retained. The primary confinement field coil support is placed outboard of the plasma cusp region by extending lobed flanges from the plates of Bitter-type primary electromagnetic field coils into the outboard region and placing the holes for the coil supports through these flanges. This arrangement of coil and flange moves plasma bombardment from the cusp region to the outboard region thus moving impurity generation by coil support bombardment from the cusp region to an outer radius where impurity effects are less detrimental.

Energized carbon rods are fed into the vessel such that the carbon rods are immersed in the water. The carbon rods are juxtaposed sufficiently that electrical arcing occurs between them, causing decomposition of some water molecules into constituent hydrogen and oxygen gas. Photon emissions resulting from the arcing are collected by photovoltaic cells placed around the sidewall of the vessel. The hydrogen gas is cooled by passing it through a water reservoir which also provides a source for water in the vessel. The cooled hydrogen gas may be used to fuel an internal combustion engine. Byproduct heat from the arcing reaction may be utilized in a Stirling engine or radiated from the system. As the carbon rods become depleted during arcing, additional rods are fed through conductive sleeves into the vessel by linear actuators.

An apparatus for producing localized concentration of energy includes: a mechanism to provide a series of projectiles and a mechanism to fire the projectiles at a target. The target is configured such that upon striking the target, a projectile traps and compresses a volume of gas between the projectile and the target. The target and the projectile are also configured such that impact of the projectile onto the target gives rise to a converging shockwave inside the trapped volume of gas.

Each target structure includes an electrically conductive body including light elements (e.g., a metal hydride/deuteride/tritide) that is configured to undergo plasmon oscillations in response to the applied EM radiation. The induced oscillations causes free electrons to converge in the localized region, thereby producing transient high electron charge density levels that enhance Coulomb repulsion screening around light element (e.g., deuterium) atoms located in the localized regions. Various systems capable of implementing enhanced Coulomb repulsion screening are described, and various nanostructure compositions and configurations are disclosed that serve to further enhance fusion reaction rates.

The fabrication of such shells is a multi-step process, which involves diamond chemical vapor deposition on predetermined mandrels followed by polishing, microfabrication of holes, and removal of the mandrel by an etch process. The resultant shells of the present invention can be configured with a surface roughness at the nanometer level (e.g., on the order of down to about 10 nm RMS) on a mm length scale, and exhibit excellent hardness/strength, and good transparency in the both the infra-red and visible. Specifically, a novel process is disclosed herein, which allows coating of spherical substrates with optical-quality diamond films or nanocrystalline diamond films.

Embodiments facilitate finer control of critical features of laser pulses for inertial fusion, as well as significant reduction in development costs and expansion of the community involved in the research relative to existing laser systems. Embodiments produce smooth intensity profiles at the target, large bandwidth that is over two orders of magnitude greater than existing laser systems, and fine control over laser wavelengths, focal properties, temporal pulse shape, and illumination geometry. Properties of each of the small pulsed lasers are individually selectable.

A magnetic guide field is created within a cylindrical chamber. The guide field has field lines axially extending within the chamber parallel to the longitudinal axis. A plasma of charged electron and ion particles is injected into the chamber. The plasma is caused to rotate, which forms a magnetic poloidal self-field surrounding the rotating plasma due to the current carried by the rotating plasma. The rotational energy of the plasma is increased to increase the magnitude of the self-field to a level that overcomes the magnetic guide field axially extending within the chamber, which causes the formation of a magnetic field within the chamber with FRC topology.

Embodiments provide free choice of useful fuels from the full range of fusible isotopes.

Computer simulations show fusion reactors constructed with these inventive improvements will demonstrate increased net-power compared to other fusion reactors of similar size. The Specification of the invention leads immediately to staged reactor development, starting from small-scale model-reactors, moving on to larger and larger scale models, culminating with commercial power plants.

Deuterium ions are introduced to the reactor adjacent to the positive electrode, and then pass from the columnating panel, through a reduced pressure chamber, and then proceed towards the negative electrode. Once the deuterium ions strike the negative electrode, they remain attached to the negative electrode so that subsequent deuterium ions following the same channels through the columnating panel are more likely to collide with them.

Orthogonal electric and magnetic fields induce azimuthal rotation of the ions around a longitudinal axis of the confinement region, the azimuthal rotation of the ions imparting azimuthal rotation to the neutrals of the first reactant, and promoting repeated collisions between one or both of the ions and the neutrals with a second reactant. The repeated collisions produce an interaction between the neutrals and the second reactant that produces a product having a nuclear mass that is different from a nuclear mass of any of the nuclei of the neutrals and the second reactant.

Magnetic field is formed in the vicinity of the target and a microwave generator irradiates microwaves into the space where the magnetic field is generated to thereby generate plasma in the space. The accelerated electrons and charged particles collide with the target to generate neutron flux. Also, to prevent the target surface from being excessively heated, the plasma is generated in a pulsed mode and target voltage is applied in a pulsed mode. To secure a continuous process, the level of target bias voltage for the target is adjusted so that the target re-adsorbs elements when the elements adsorbed on the target are depleted.

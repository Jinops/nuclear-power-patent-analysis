The dust cloud shields the surface of the planet from some sunlight. One aspect of the invention relates to detonating an explosive to generate a dust cloud and to create an updraft to lift the dust cloud into the atmosphere where it can be spread by winds over the area to be cooled. The dust in the atmosphere blocks sunlight from reaching the surface, allowing the planet to cool. Multiple explosions at multiple locations or at the same location may be use for greater cooling. Explosions may be caused by nuclear weapons or by the impact of an asteroid or comet.",FALSE,"ipa110113.xml","13f05eea-16c8-11ed-9b5f-1234bde3cd05","San Jose","CA","US",37.3361663,-121.890591,"Santa Clara",6,85,1,"3ea4e431-ea70-4a1e-996e-380f4b7e7709","Stephen","Trimberger","",4

Detonation of a nuclear warhead or geomagnetic storms created by solar corona ejecta or an attack by directed energy weapons can create an electromagnetic pulse event. Several embodiments are disclosed that use radio frequency (RF) sensors, electrostatic discharge sensors and geomagnetic sensors that feed sensor signals to an event characterization and detection unit that analyzes and predicts early occurrence of an electromagnetic pulse event. Critical sensor signals are recorded for future use and are used to refine autonomic algorithms used to predict future electromagnetic pulse events from the sensor data.",FALSE,"ipa160811.xml","09e25130-16c8-11ed-9b5f-1234bde3cd05","Waltham","MA","US",42.3756401,-71.2358004,"Middlesex",25,17,1,"504d1121-c994-4dd3-a975-82998e69fba0","","","Raytheon Company",2

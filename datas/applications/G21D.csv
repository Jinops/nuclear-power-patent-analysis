Scientific feasibility is established by studying the behavior of nuclear fuels in configurations designed to support a fission chain reaction. Nanofuel is defined as nuclear fuel suitable for use in an internal engine, comprised of six essential ingredients, and can be created from clean fuel or from the transuranic elements found in light-water reactor spent nuclear fuel in a proliferation resistant manner. Three essential ingredients ensure the nanofuel is inherently stable, due to a negative temperature coefficient of reactivity. Reciprocating and Wankel (rotary) internal engine configurations, which operate in an Otto cycle, are adapted to support a fission chain reaction. Dynamic engine cores experience a decrease in criticality as the engine piston or rotor moves away from the top dead center position. In this inherent safety feature, the increase in engine core volume decreases the nanofuel density and increases the neutron leakage. Technological feasibility is demonstrated by examining potential engineering limitations. The nanofuel internal engine can be operated in two modes: spark-ignition with an external neutron source such as a fusion neutron generator; and compression-ignition with an internal neutron source. The structural integrity can be maintained using standard internal combustion engine design and operation practices. The fuel system can be operated in a closed thermodynamic cycle, which allows for complete fuel utilization, continuous refueling, and easy fission product extraction. Nanofuel engine power plant configurations offer favorable economic, safety, and waste management attributes when compared to existing power generation technology.

The pulse reaction initiates a heat cycle by expanding working fluid, extracting mechanical work and compressing the working fluid using lower amount of energy. The energy released in reaction can drive a column of water as a liquid piston propelling a highly efficient hydraulic turbine and producing a simple economical method of energy conversion. The piston movements can also be converted in laser and electromagnetic pulses. Self-regulation of nuclear reaction by a reflector piston linked to a resilient spring can be used in marine propulsion. In one method, the approach of the reflector piston triggers a reaction that evaporates water in the pressure chamber and produces a reactive thrust in a noozle.

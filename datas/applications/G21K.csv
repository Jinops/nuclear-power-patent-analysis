A pixel specifying portion specifies particular pixels of the various pixels that comprise an x-ray image. An intensity estimating portion estimates the scattered x-ray intensities (scattered radiation intensities) at the particular pixels specified by the pixel specifying portion and/or the direct x-ray intensities (the direct radiation intensities) of the particular pixels. Consequently, it is possible to estimate appropriately the scattered x-ray intensities and/or direct x-ray intensities at the particular pixels in consideration of the status of installation of a grid (scattered radiation removing means).",FALSE,"ipa101125.xml","881ecc4c-16c8-11ed-9b5f-1234bde3cd05","Kyoto","","JP",35.021041,135.7556075,"",NA,NA,1,"e5504c3d-7407-4050-8441-b84922b68603","","","Shimadzu Corporation",3

A reflective surface of the collector is the first bundle-forming surface downstream of the radiation source. The reflective surface is formed such that it converts the radiation source into a family of images in a downstream plane. The family of images includes a plurality of radiation source images which are offset to each other in two dimensions (x, y) in a direction perpendicular to the beam direction of the transformed radiation bundle and are arranged relative to each other in a non-rotationally symmetric manner relative to the beam direction of the transformed radiation bundle. The transformed radiation bundle in the downstream plane has a non-rotationally symmetric bundle edge contour relative to the beam direction of the transformed radiation bundle. The result is a collector in which the radiation bundle shape generated by the collector. In other words, the illumination distribution generated by the collector in a defined manner in the plane downstream of the collector has a shape which is freely selectable to the greatest possible extent.",FALSE,"ipa100916.xml","6571778f-16c8-11ed-9b5f-1234bde3cd05","Oberkochen","","DE",48.7855073,10.1106691,"",NA,NA,1,"59ab2486-7396-4580-906f-b30ca8c4d65c","","","Carl Zeiss SMT GmbH",3

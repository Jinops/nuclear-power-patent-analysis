A magnetic guide field is created within a cylindrical chamber. The guide field has field lines axially extending within the chamber parallel to the longitudinal axis. A plasma of charged electron and ion particles is injected into the chamber. The plasma is caused to rotate, which forms a magnetic poloidal self-field surrounding the rotating plasma due to the current carried by the rotating plasma. The rotational energy of the plasma is increased to increase the magnitude of the self-field to a level that overcomes the magnetic guide field axially extending within the chamber, which causes the

In a BWR, the injection device is operable without electricity and at a wide range of pressures, even less than 50 pounds per square inch, to maintain coolant levels in the reactor.","patent_date":"2016-10-04","inventors":[{"inventor_country":"US","inventor_key_id":"670758"}],"assignees":[{"assignee_country":"US","assignee_key_id":"14953"}],"applications":[{"app_number":"13425985","app_date":"2012-03-21","app_id":"13\/425985"}],"cited_patents":[{"cited_patent_number":"3282227"},{"cited_patent_number":"3935063"},{"cited_patent_number":"4035231"},{"cited_patent_number":"4051892"},{"cited_patent_number":"4440719"},{"cited_patent_number":"5011652"},{"cited_patent_number":"5169595"},{"cited_patent_number":"5262091"},{"cited_patent_number":"5349616"},{"cited_patent_number":"6912263"},{"cited_patent_number":"7154982"}],"citedby_patents":[{"citedby_patent_number":"10726961"},{"citedby_patent_number":"10950358"},{"citedby_patent_number":"9779840"}],"cpcs":[{"cpc_section_id":"G","cpc_group_id":"G21D","cpc_subgroup_id":"G21D1\/02","cpc_group_title":"Nuclear power plant","cpc_subgroup_title":"Details of nuclear power plant -Arrangements of auxiliary equipment"},{"cpc_section_id":"G","cpc_group_id":"G21C","cpc_subgroup_id":"G21C15\/18","cpc_group_title":"Nuclear reactors","cpc_subgroup_title":"Cooling arrangements within the pressure vessel containing the core; Selection of specific coolants-Emergency cooling arrangements; Removing shut-down heat"},{"cpc_section_id":"G","cpc_group_id":"G21D","cpc_subgroup_id":"G21D3\/06","cpc_group_title":"Nuclear power plant","cpc_subgroup_title":"Control of nuclear power plant -Safety arrangements -responsive to faults within the plant"},{"cpc_section_id":"G","cpc_group_id":"G21C","cpc_subgroup_id":"G21C15\/185","cpc_group_title":"Nuclear reactors","cpc_subgroup_title":"Cooling arrangements within the pressure vessel containing the core; Selection of specific coolants-Emergency cooling arrangements; Removing shut-down heat-comprising powered means, e.g. pumps-using energy stored in reactor system"},{"cpc_section_id":"Y","cpc_group_id":"Y02E","cpc_subgroup_id":"Y02E30\/00","cpc_group_title":"Reduction of greenhouse gas [ghg] emissions, related to energy generation, transmission or distribution","cpc_subgroup_title":"Energy generation of nuclear origin"},{"cpc_section_id":"Y","cpc_group_id":"Y02E","cpc_subgroup_id":"Y02E30\/30","cpc_group_title":"Reduction of greenhouse gas [ghg] emissions, related to energy generation, transmission or distribution","cpc_subgroup_title":"Energy generation of nuclear origin-Nuclear fission reactors"}]},{"patent_number":"10424416","patent_title":"Low temperature thermal energy converter for use with spent nuclear fuel rods","patent_abstract":"According to an aspect, a vapor powered apparatus for generating electric power includes a liquid chamber that contains a working fluid and a first heat exchanger that transfers heat from fluid coming from a heat source to working fluid coming from the liquid chamber, where the transferred heat vaporizes at least a portion of the working fluid to provide a working pressure of the vaporized working fluid.

Scientific feasibility is established by studying the behavior of nuclear fuels in configurations designed to support a fission chain reaction. Nanofuel is defined as nuclear fuel suitable for use in an internal engine, comprised of six essential ingredients, and can be created from clean fuel or from the transuranic elements found in light-water reactor spent nuclear fuel in a proliferation resistant manner. Three essential ingredients ensure the nanofuel is inherently stable, due to a negative temperature coefficient of reactivity. Reciprocating and Wankel (rotary) internal engine configurations, which operate in an Otto cycle, are adapted to support a fission chain reaction. Dynamic engine cores experience a decrease in criticality as the engine piston or rotor moves away from the top dead center position. In this inherent safety feature, the increase in engine core volume decreases the nanofuel density and increases the neutron leakage. Technological feasibility is demonstrated by examining potential engineering limitations. The nanofuel internal engine can be operated in two modes: spark-ignition with an external neutron source such as a fusion neutron generator; and compression-ignition with an internal neutron source. The structural integrity can be maintained using standard internal combustion engine design and operation practices. The fuel system can be operated in a closed thermodynamic cycle, which allows for complete fuel utilization, continuous refueling, and easy fission product extraction. Nanofuel engine power plant configurations offer favorable economic, safety, and waste management attributes when compared to existing power generation technology.

The reactor receives reactants and an expandable propellant fluid such as hydrogen, and confines heated and pressurized gases for discharge out through a throat, and into a rocket engine expansion nozzle for propulsive discharge.","patent_date":"2016-05-24","inventors":[{"inventor_country":"US","inventor_key_id":"185514"},{"inventor_country":"US","inventor_key_id":"1076592"}],"assignees":[{"assignee_country":null,"assignee_key_id":null}],"applications":[{"app_number":"14851665","app_date":"2015-09-11","app_id":"14\/851665"}],"cited_patents":[{"cited_patent_number":"3202582"},{"cited_patent_number":"3203173"},{"cited_patent_number":"3270496"},{"cited_patent_number":"3315471"},{"cited_patent_number":"3374148"},{"cited_patent_number":"3383858"},{"cited_patent_number":"3546069"},{"cited_patent_number":"3574057"},{"cited_patent_number":"3711370"},{"cited_patent_number":"3714782"},{"cited_patent_number":"4036012"},{"cited_patent_number":"4121971"},{"cited_patent_number":"4269659"},{"cited_patent_number":"4401618"},{"cited_patent_number":"4426843"},{"cited_patent_number":"4666678"},{"cited_patent_number":"4802639"},{"cited_patent_number":"H1501"},{"cited_patent_number":"5475722"},{"cited_patent_number":"5636512"},{"cited_patent_number":"5873239"},{"cited_patent_number":"6876714"},{"cited_patent_number":"9180985"}],"citedby_patents":[{"citedby_patent_number":"10414520"},{"citedby_patent_number":"10414521"},{"citedby_patent_number":"10609808"},{"citedby_patent_number":"10701792"},{"citedby_patent_number":"9938026"}],"cpcs":[{"cpc_section_id":"B","cpc_group_id":"B64G","cpc_subgroup_id":"B64G1\/408","cpc_group_title":"Cosmonautics; vehicles or equipment therefor","cpc_subgroup_title":"Cosmonautic vehicles-Parts of, or equipment specially adapted for fitting in or to, cosmonautic vehicles-Arrangements or adaptations of propulsion systems -Nuclear spacecraft propulsion"},{"cpc_section_id":"B","cpc_group_id":"B64G","cpc_subgroup_id":"B64G1\/401","cpc_group_title":"Cosmonautics; vehicles or equipment therefor","cpc_subgroup_title":"Cosmonautic vehicles-Parts of, or equipment specially adapted for fitting in or to, cosmonautic vehicles-Arrangements or adaptations of propulsion systems -Liquid propellant rocket engines"},{"cpc_section_id":"B","cpc_group_id":"B64G","cpc_subgroup_id":"B64G1\/409","cpc_group_title":"Cosmonautics; vehicles or equipment therefor","cpc_subgroup_title":"Cosmonautic vehicles-Parts of, or equipment specially adapted for fitting in or to, cosmonautic vehicles-Arrangements or adaptations of propulsion systems -Unconventional spacecraft propulsion systems"},{"cpc_section_id":"F","cpc_group_id":"F02K","cpc_subgroup_id":"F02K9\/42","cpc_group_title":"Jet-propulsion plants","cpc_subgroup_title":"Rocket-engine plants, i.e. plants carrying both fuel and oxidant therefor; Control thereof-using liquid or gaseous propellants"},{"cpc_section_id":"F","cpc_group_id":"F02K","cpc_subgroup_id":"F02K9\/70","cpc_group_title":"Jet-propulsion plants","cpc_subgroup_title":"Rocket-engine plants, i.e. plants carrying both fuel and oxidant therefor; Control thereof-using semi- solid or pulverulent propellants"},{"cpc_section_id":"F","cpc_group_id":"F02K","cpc_subgroup_id":"F02K7\/08","cpc_group_title":"Jet-propulsion plants","cpc_subgroup_title":"Plants in which the working fluid is used in a jet only, i.e. the plants not having a turbine or other engine driving a compressor or a ducted fan; Control thereof -the jet being continuous"},{"cpc_section_id":"F","cpc_group_id":"F05D","cpc_subgroup_id":"F05D2210\/12","cpc_group_title":"Indexing scheme for aspects relating to non-positive-displacement machines or engines, gas-turbines or jet-propulsion plants","cpc_subgroup_title":"Working fluids-Kind or type-gaseous, i.e. compressible"},{"cpc_section_id":"G","cpc_group_id":"G21D","cpc_subgroup_id":"G21D5\/02","cpc_group_title":"Nuclear power plant","cpc_subgroup_title":"Arrangements of reactor and engine in which reactor-produced heat is converted into mechanical energy-Reactor and engine structurally combined, e.g. portable"}]},{"patent_number":"11289224","patent_title":"Nuclear-power-plant computer-based procedure display device, safety control and monitoring system, and plant operation monitoring system","patent_abstract":"A nuclear-power-plant computer-based procedure display device is disposed in a main control room of a nuclear power plant, and includes a operating procedure storage unit that stores a computer-based procedure in which plant operation procedures of the nuclear power plant are divided into procedure steps and listed, a operating procedure display unit that displays the computer-based procedure, and a operating procedure display control unit that controls display of the computer-based procedure.

The water is then directed to a hot water accumulator, in which the water is heated by the closed loop heat exchanger. The water is vaporized by a hot plate and a UV light source. The distilled water is then cooled in a cooling tower and delivered to water tower as purified water.","patent_date":"2020-06-30","inventors":[{"inventor_country":"US","inventor_key_id":"2211849"}],"assignees":[{"assignee_country":null,"assignee_key_id":null}],"applications":[{"app_number":"16105514","app_date":"2018-08-20","app_id":"16\/105514"}],"cited_patents":[{"cited_patent_number":"4121977"},{"cited_patent_number":"4280912"},{"cited_patent_number":"5405503"},{"cited_patent_number":"5443739"},{"cited_patent_number":"5925223"},{"cited_patent_number":"6539718"},{"cited_patent_number":"6830661"},{"cited_patent_number":"6833056"},{"cited_patent_number":"6919000"},{"cited_patent_number":"7073337"},{"cited_patent_number":"8623174"},{"cited_patent_number":"9644500"},{"cited_patent_number":"10039996"},{"cited_patent_number":"10166489"}],"citedby_patents":[{"citedby_patent_number":null}],"cpcs":[{"cpc_section_id":"B","cpc_group_id":"B01D","cpc_subgroup_id":"B01D3\/10","cpc_group_title":"Separation","cpc_subgroup_title":"Distillation or related exchange processes in which liquids are contacted with gaseous media, e.g. stripping -Vacuum distillation"},{"cpc_section_id":"B","cpc_group_id":"B01D","cpc_subgroup_id":"B01D1\/0029","cpc_group_title":"Separation","cpc_subgroup_title":"Evaporating -Heating features-Use of radiation"},{"cpc_section_id":"B","cpc_group_id":"B01D","cpc_subgroup_id":"B01D1\/0058","cpc_group_title":"Separation","cpc_subgroup_title":"Evaporating -Heating features-Use of waste energy from other processes or sources, e.g. combustion gas"},{"cpc_section_id":"B","cpc_group_id":"B01D","cpc_subgroup_id":"B01D5\/006","cpc_group_title":"Separation","cpc_subgroup_title":"Condensation of vapours;

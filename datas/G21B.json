fuels.","patent_date":"2017-06-06","inventors":[{"inventor_country":"US","inventor_key_id":"100301"},{"inventor_country":"US","inventor_key_id":"241056"}],"assignees":[{"assignee_country":"US","assignee_key_id":"164"}],"applications":[{"app_number":"15172069","app_date":"2016-06-02","app_id":"15\/172069"}],"cited_patents":[{"cited_patent_number":"3036963"},{"cited_patent_number":"3071525"},{"cited_patent_number":"3120470"},{"cited_patent_number":"3132996"},{"cited_patent_number":"3170841"},{"cited_patent_number":"3182213"},{"cited_patent_number":"3258402"},{"cited_patent_number":"3386883"},{"cited_patent_number":"3527977"},{"cited_patent_number":"3530036"},{"cited_patent_number":"3530497"},{"cited_patent_number":"3577317"},{"cited_patent_number":"3621310"},{"cited_patent_number":"3663362"},{"cited_patent_number":"3664921"},{"cited_patent_number":"3668065"},{"cited_patent_number":"3859164"},{"cited_patent_number":"4010396"},{"cited_patent_number":"4054846"},{"cited_patent_number":"4057462"},{"cited_patent_number":"4065351"},{"cited_patent_number":"4098643"},{"cited_patent_number":"4182650"},{"cited_patent_number":"4189346"},{"cited_patent_number":"4202725"},{"cited_patent_number":"4233537"},{"cited_patent_number":"4246067"},{"cited_patent_number":"4267488"},{"cited_patent_number":"4274919"},{"cited_patent_number":"4303467"},{"cited_patent_number":"4314879"},{"cited_patent_number":"4317057"},{"cited_patent_number":"4347621"},{"cited_patent_number":"4350927"},{"cited_patent_number":"4371808"},{"cited_patent_number":"4390494"},{"cited_patent_number":"4397810"},{"cited_patent_number":"4416845"},{"cited_patent_number":"4434130"},{"cited_patent_number":"4483737"},{"cited_patent_number":"4543231"},{"cited_patent_number":"4543465"},{"cited_patent_number":"4548782"},{"cited_patent_number":"4560528"},{"cited_patent_number":"4584160"},{"cited_patent_number":"4584473"},{"cited_patent_number":"4601871"},{"cited_patent_number":"4615755"},{"cited_patent_number":"4618470"},{"cited_patent_number":"4630939"},{"cited_patent_number":"4639348"},{"cited_patent_number":"4650631"},{"cited_patent_number":"4687616"},{"cited_patent_number":"4826646"},{"cited_patent_number":"4853173"},{"cited_patent_number":"4894199"},{"cited_patent_number":"4904441"},{"cited_patent_number":"5015432"},{"cited_patent_number":"5041760"},{"cited_patent_number":"5122662"},{"cited_patent_number":"5160694"},{"cited_patent_number":"5160695"},{"cited_patent_number":"5206516"},{"cited_patent_number":"5207760"},{"cited_patent_number":"5339336"},{"cited_patent_number":"5355399"},{"cited_patent_number":"5420425"},{"cited_patent_number":"5422481"},{"cited_patent_number":"5473165"},{"cited_patent_number":"5483077"},{"cited_patent_number":"5502354"},{"cited_patent_number":"5537005"},{"cited_patent_number":"5557172"},{"cited_patent_number":"5656519"},{"cited_patent_number":"5677597"},{"cited_patent_number":"5747800"},{"cited_patent_number":"5764715"},{"cited_patent_number":"5811201"},{"cited_patent_number":"5846329"},{"cited_patent_number":"5848110"},{"cited_patent_number":"5923716"},{"cited_patent_number":"6000360"},{"cited_patent_number":"6084356"},{"cited_patent_number":"6248251"},{"cited_patent_number":"6255648"},{"cited_patent_number":"6271529"},{"cited_patent_number":"6322706"},{"cited_patent_number":"6335535"},{"cited_patent_number":"6345537"},{"cited_patent_number":"6390019"},{"cited_patent_number":"6396213"},{"cited_patent_number":"6408052"},{"cited_patent_number":"6452168"},{"cited_patent_number":"6477216"},{"cited_patent_number":"6488807"},{"cited_patent_number":"6593539"},{"cited_patent_number":"6593570"},{"cited_patent_number":"6611106"},{"cited_patent_number":"6632324"},{"cited_patent_number":"6664740"},{"cited_patent_number":"6712927"},{"cited_patent_number":"6755086"},{"cited_patent_number":"6850011"},{"cited_patent_number":"7115887"},{"cited_patent_number":"7126284"},{"cited_patent_number":"7129656"},{"cited_patent_number":"7439678"},{"cited_patent_number":"7569995"},{"cited_patent_number":"8461762"}],"citedby_patents":[{"citedby_patent_number":"10049774"},{"citedby_patent_number":"10217532"},{"citedby_patent_number":"10361005"},{"citedby_patent_number":"10418170"},{"citedby_patent_number":"10438702"},{"citedby_patent_number":"10440806"},{"citedby_patent_number":"10446275"},{"citedby_patent_number":"10665351"},{"citedby_patent_number":"10743398"},{"citedby_patent_number":"10790064"},{"citedby_patent_number":"10910149"},{"citedby_patent_number":"11195627"},{"citedby_patent_number":"11200990"},{"citedby_patent_number":"11211172"},{"citedby_patent_number":"11217351"},{"citedby_patent_number":"11335467"},{"citedby_patent_number":"11337294"},{"citedby_patent_number":"11373763"},{"citedby_patent_number":"9997261"}],"cpcs":[{"cpc_section_id":"G","cpc_group_id":"G21B","cpc_subgroup_id":"G21B1\/052","cpc_group_title":"Fusion

MG) under typical NIF implosion conditions may significantly relax the conditions required for ignition and propagating burn in NIF ignition targets that are degraded by hydrodynamic instabilities. Such magnetic fields can: (a) permit the recovery of ignition, or at least significant alpha particle heating, in submarginal NIF targets that would otherwise fail because of adverse hydrodynamic instability growth, (b) permit the attainment of ignition in conventional cryogenic layered solid-DT targets redesigned to operate under reduced drive conditions, (c) permit the attainment of volumetric ignition in simpler, room-temperature single-shell DT gas capsules, and (d) ameliorate adverse hohlraum plasma conditions during laser drive and capsule compression. In general, an applied magnetic field should always improve the ignition condition for any NIF ignition target design.","patent_date":"2018-11-20","inventors":[{"inventor_country":"US","inventor_key_id":"38290"},{"inventor_country":"US","inventor_key_id":"920584"},{"inventor_country":"US","inventor_key_id":"2187889"},{"inventor_country":"US","inventor_key_id":"2484115"},{"inventor_country":"US","inventor_key_id":"2623619"},{"inventor_country":"US","inventor_key_id":"2992192"}],"assignees":[{"assignee_country":"US","assignee_key_id":"2572"}],"applications":[{"app_number":"14278611","app_date":"2014-05-15","app_id":"14\/278611"}],"cited_patents":[{"cited_patent_number":"4277305"},{"cited_patent_number":"8837661"}],"citedby_patents":[{"citedby_patent_number":null}],"cpcs":[{"cpc_section_id":"G","cpc_group_id":"G21B","cpc_subgroup_id":"G21B1\/05","cpc_group_title":"Fusion reactors","cpc_subgroup_title":"Thermonuclear fusion reactors-with magnetic or electric plasma confinement"},{"cpc_section_id":"G","cpc_group_id":"G21B","cpc_subgroup_id":"G21B1\/03","cpc_group_title":"Fusion reactors","cpc_subgroup_title":"Thermonuclear fusion reactors-with inertial plasma confinement"},{"cpc_section_id":"G","cpc_group_id":"G21B","cpc_subgroup_id":"G21B1\/19","cpc_group_title":"Fusion reactors","cpc_subgroup_title":"Thermonuclear fusion reactors-Details-Targets for producing thermonuclear fusion reactions, e.g. pellets for irradiation by laser or charged particle beams"},{"cpc_section_id":"Y","cpc_group_id":"Y02E","cpc_subgroup_id":"Y02E30\/10","cpc_group_title":"Reduction of greenhouse gas [ghg] emissions, related to energy generation, transmission or distribution","cpc_subgroup_title":"Energy generation of nuclear origin-Nuclear fusion reactors"}]},{"patent_number":"11165216","patent_title":"Arrangement of expanding optical flows for efficient laser extraction","patent_abstract":"A set of optical elements for optical extraction composed of packed expanding optical cross sections to efficiently extract from a large gain region.

ions are contained magnetically in stable, non-adiabatic orbits in the FRC. Further, the electrons are contained electrostatically in a deep energy well, created by tuning an externally applied magnetic field. The simultaneous electrostatic confinement of electrons and magnetic confinement of ions avoids anomalous transport and facilitates classical containment of both electrons and ions.

The simultaneous electrostatic confinement of electrons and magnetic confinement of ions avoids anomalous transport and facilitates classical containment of both electrons and ions.

In this configuration, ions and electrons may have adequate density and temperature so that upon collisions they are fused together by the nuclear force, thus forming fusion products that emerge in the form of an annular beam. Energy is removed from the fusion product ions as they spiral past electrodes of an inverse cyclotron converter.

The particles passes through an electromagnet energized by a low inductance current feed incorporating a light activated switch to turn the energizing current on and off. Part of the light of the laser pulse is directed onto the light activated switch, such that the magnetic field is optically synchronized with the generated pulses of charged particles. This enables energizing the magnet only during passage of the pulses, such that it is lighter and more energy efficient than prior art systems using CW electromagnets. Synchronization also enables selection of charged particles having a predetermined range of particle energy, by timing activation of the magnetic field such that it diverts onto a selected beam path only the particles having the predetermined range of energies.","patent_date":"2016-12-27","inventors":[{"inventor_country":"IL","inventor_key_id":"245284"},{"inventor_country":"IL","inventor_key_id":"868514"},{"inventor_country":"IL","inventor_key_id":"1156458"},{"inventor_country":"IL","inventor_key_id":"2440569"},{"inventor_country":"IL","inventor_key_id":"2622530"}],"assignees":[{"assignee_country":"IL","assignee_key_id":"145583"}],"applications":[{"app_number":"14375204","app_date":"2013-01-31","app_id":"14\/375204"}],"cited_patents":[{"cited_patent_number":"2101669"},{"cited_patent_number":"4186409"},{"cited_patent_number":"4301362"},{"cited_patent_number":"5335258"},{"cited_patent_number":"5930331"},{"cited_patent_number":"5952970"},{"cited_patent_number":"6448722"},{"cited_patent_number":"6906338"},{"cited_patent_number":"7501644"}],"citedby_patents":[{"citedby_patent_number":"10039935"},{"citedby_patent_number":"10395881"},{"citedby_patent_number":"10847340"},{"citedby_patent_number":"9937360"}],"cpcs":[{"cpc_section_id":"A","cpc_group_id":"A61N","cpc_subgroup_id":"A61N5\/1077","cpc_group_title":"Electrotherapy; magnetotherapy; radiation therapy; ultrasound therapy","cpc_subgroup_title":"Radiation therapy -X-ray therapy; Gamma-ray therapy; Particle-irradiation therapy -Beam delivery systems"},{"cpc_section_id":"A","cpc_group_id":"A61N","cpc_subgroup_id":"A61N2005\/1087","cpc_group_title":"Electrotherapy; magnetotherapy; radiation therapy; ultrasound therapy","cpc_subgroup_title":"Radiation therapy -X-ray therapy; Gamma-ray therapy; Particle-irradiation therapy -characterised by the type of particles applied to the patient-Ions;  Protons"},{"cpc_section_id":"G","cpc_group_id":"G21B","cpc_subgroup_id":"G21B3\/006","cpc_group_title":"Fusion reactors","cpc_subgroup_title":"Low temperature nuclear fusion reactors, e.g. alleged cold fusion reactors-Fusion by impact, e.g. cluster\/beam interaction, ion beam collisions, impact on a target"},{"cpc_section_id":"G","cpc_group_id":"G21K","cpc_subgroup_id":"G21K1\/093","cpc_group_title":"Techniques for handling particles or ionising radiation not otherwise provided for; irradiation devices; gamma ray or x-ray microscopes","cpc_subgroup_title":"Arrangements for handling particles or ionising radiation, e.g. focusing or moderating -Deviation, concentration or focusing of the beam by electric or magnetic means -by magnetic means"},{"cpc_section_id":"H","cpc_group_id":"H01J","cpc_subgroup_id":"H01J27\/022","cpc_group_title":"Electric discharge tubes or discharge lamps","cpc_subgroup_title":"Ion beam tubes -Ion sources; Ion guns -Details"},{"cpc_section_id":"H","cpc_group_id":"H01J","cpc_subgroup_id":"H01J27\/18","cpc_group_title":"Electric discharge tubes or discharge lamps","cpc_subgroup_title":"Ion beam tubes -Ion sources; Ion guns -using high-frequency excitation, e.g. microwave excitation-with an applied axial magnetic field"},{"cpc_section_id":"Y","cpc_group_id":"Y02E","cpc_subgroup_id":"Y02E30\/10","cpc_group_title":"Reduction of greenhouse gas [ghg] emissions, related to energy generation, transmission or distribution","cpc_subgroup_title":"Energy generation of nuclear origin-Nuclear fusion reactors"}]},{"patent_number":"10720243","patent_title":"Laser amplification apparatus, laser apparatus, and laser nuclear fusion reactor","patent_abstract":"The laser amplification apparatus is provided with a plurality of plate-shaped laser medium components (M1 to M4) which are disposed to be aligned along a thickness direction, and prisms (P1 to P3) which optically couples the laser medium components.

The exciting pump pulses are directed into a lookthrough compression arrangement wherein they energize a stimulated scattering process in low pressure (about 1 atmosphere) gaseous media and impinge in an off axis backward geometry. The extraction pulse is formed and directed towards the target with the appropriate information (color, phase, desired irradiance pattern) impressed on it at relatively low energy by manipulation with conventional, solid material optical elements. Once formed, it traverses the gaseous media, is amplified, and proceeds through a vacuum transition section and onto the target. After the injection of the extraction pulse into the lookthrough compression arrangement, it is amplified in the gaseous media by conversion of the pump energy, coupled through the scattering process. The media and the pump and extraction pulses are tailored to give high energy gain to the input optical pulse, high output fluence, good beam quality (high fidelity amplification to the desired temporal and spatial shape), and time compression. Once injected into the entrance to the first section by the material elements, the extraction pulse proceeds through shutter areas that separate different media regions and encounter no further solid material optical elements as it travels to the target. The focus on the target is impressed before amplification and time compression from the pump pulses and results in a very high brightness irradiance of the target. The desired spatial pattern of irradiance on the target is likewise formed with material elements and then imaged onto the target. Fluences some 2-3 orders of magnitude above those available under the conventional art may be thus obtained with an output brightness better by some six orders of magnitude.","patent_date":"2020-09-08","inventors":[{"inventor_country":"US","inventor_key_id":"37946"}],"assignees":[{"assignee_country":null,"assignee_key_id":null}],"applications":[{"app_number":"15788429","app_date":"2017-10-19","app_id":"15\/788429"}],"cited_patents":[{"cited_patent_number":"5033051"},{"cited_patent_number":"5062112"}],"citedby_patents":[{"citedby_patent_number":null}],"cpcs":[{"cpc_section_id":"G","cpc_group_id":"G21B","cpc_subgroup_id":"G21B1\/03","cpc_group_title":"Fusion reactors","cpc_subgroup_title":"Thermonuclear fusion reactors-with inertial plasma confinement"},{"cpc_section_id":"H","cpc_group_id":"H01S","cpc_subgroup_id":"H01S3\/305","cpc_group_title":"Devices using the process of light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation [laser] to amplify or generate light;

The propellant and fusion products are directed out of the reactor chamber through a magnetic nozzle and are detached from the magnetic field lines producing thrust.","patent_date":"2017-11-21","inventors":[{"inventor_country":"US","inventor_key_id":"311777"},{"inventor_country":"US","inventor_key_id":"993606"},{"inventor_country":"US","inventor_key_id":"1198835"},{"inventor_country":"US","inventor_key_id":"2005659"}],"assignees":[{"assignee_country":"US","assignee_key_id":"1726"},{"assignee_country":"US","assignee_key_id":"41392"}],"applications":[{"app_number":"14400204","app_date":"2013-05-10","app_id":"14\/400204"}],"cited_patents":[{"cited_patent_number":"6334302"}],"citedby_patents":[{"citedby_patent_number":"10752385"}],"cpcs":[{"cpc_section_id":"B","cpc_group_id":"B64G","cpc_subgroup_id":"B64G1\/408","cpc_group_title":"Cosmonautics; vehicles or equipment therefor","cpc_subgroup_title":"Cosmonautic vehicles-Parts of, or equipment specially adapted for fitting in or to, cosmonautic vehicles-Arrangements or adaptations of propulsion systems -Nuclear spacecraft propulsion"},{"cpc_section_id":"F","cpc_group_id":"F02K","cpc_subgroup_id":"F02K9\/08","cpc_group_title":"Jet-propulsion plants","cpc_subgroup_title":"Rocket-engine plants, i.e. plants carrying both fuel and oxidant therefor; Control thereof-using solid propellants"},{"cpc_section_id":"F","cpc_group_id":"F03H","cpc_subgroup_id":"F03H1\/0093","cpc_group_title":"Producing a reactive propulsive thrust, not otherwise provided for","cpc_subgroup_title":"Using plasma to produce a reactive propulsive thrust -Electro-thermal plasma thrusters, i.e. thrusters heating the particles in a plasma"},{"cpc_section_id":"G","cpc_group_id":"G21B","cpc_subgroup_id":"G21B1\/052","cpc_group_title":"Fusion reactors","cpc_subgroup_title":"Thermonuclear fusion reactors-with magnetic or electric plasma confinement-reversed field configuration"},{"cpc_section_id":"Y","cpc_group_id":"Y02E","cpc_subgroup_id":"Y02E30\/10","cpc_group_title":"Reduction of greenhouse gas [ghg] emissions, related to energy generation, transmission or distribution","cpc_subgroup_title":"Energy generation of nuclear origin-Nuclear fusion reactors"}]},{"patent_number":"10170883","patent_title":"Method for direct compression of laser pulses with large temporal ratios","patent_abstract":"The present architecture utilizes a Nonlinear Scattering Aperture Combiner that does not need to be optically multiplexed and then drives a Direct Compressor stage that produces a large temporal compression ratio to pump a Fast Compressor. This eliminates the need for a separate array of ATDMs, multiplexing optical elements, and, at the approximate 107 joule energy output required for ICF, reduces the number of mechanical elements and gas interfaces from the order of 103 to about 10. In addition, this provides a large reduction of the volume of the gas containment region. In order to accomplish this, a technique for transversely segmenting by color and\/or polarization of the optical extraction beams of the Direct Compressor has been invented. In particular, it emphasizes the simplicity and uniqueness of design of the Direct Compressor. The Direct Compressor is unique in terms of high fluence, high temporal compression ratios, and high stage gain, leading to a very large reduction in laser costs. It may separately have many other applications than ICF.","patent_date":"2019-01-01","inventors":[{"inventor_country":"US","inventor_key_id":"37946"}],"assignees":[{"assignee_country":"US","assignee_key_id":"145788"}],"applications":[{"app_number":"15851484","app_date":"2017-12-21","app_id":"15\/851484"}],"cited_patents":[{"cited_patent_number":"6657188"}],"citedby_patents":[{"citedby_patent_number":"10862260"},{"citedby_patent_number":"11165216"}],"cpcs":[{"cpc_section_id":"G","cpc_group_id":"G21B","cpc_subgroup_id":"G21B1\/03","cpc_group_title":"Fusion reactors","cpc_subgroup_title":"Thermonuclear fusion reactors-with inertial plasma confinement"},{"cpc_section_id":"H","cpc_group_id":"H01S","cpc_subgroup_id":"H01S3\/0057","cpc_group_title":"Devices using the process of light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation [laser] to amplify or generate light;

In this configuration, ions and electrons may have adequate density and temperature so that upon collisions ions are fused together by the nuclear force, thus forming fusion products that emerge in the form of an annular beam. Energy is removed from the fusion product ions as they spiral past electrodes of an inverse cyclotron converter.
